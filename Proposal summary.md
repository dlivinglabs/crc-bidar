This project proposes to rethink understandings of climate research through and together with local knowledge practices. It is an action-research collaboration to establish a Climate Resource Centre (CRC) in Bidar District, that will operate as a site for knowledge co-production alongside the
community. The CRC will provide a platform where experiences, practices and responses within Bidar’s agricultural practices are documented and disseminated under the specific umbrella of climate change. The project seeks to inform climate adaptation, outreach and action at the hyper-local scale.
We seek to decentre mainstream, ‘expert’-led understandings in climate adaptation research - centering the understandings, experiences, and priorities of Bidar’s farmers in response to the changing climate in the Dakkhani region. The Resource Centre will also provide a platform where these practices are expanded upon and exchanged with others in the region - directing existing vocational knowledge as well as new community-led ideas towards understanding and addressing the effects of climate change.
